# SceneScoutW
The 1 .exe wrapper around [@Mark-Shun/SceneScout](https://github.com/Mark-Shun/SceneScout)

* Drag video files and folders onto `SceneScoutW.exe` and *it* will do the necessary setup for SceneScout.
* You can also run `SceneScoutW.exe` without dragging files into it to do only the prerequisite checks.
